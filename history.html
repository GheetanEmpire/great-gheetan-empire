    <h2>History of the Great Gheetan Empire</h2>

    <h3>Founding & Early Days (Year 1 - Year 2)</h3>
    <p>The Great Gheetan Empire was founded on July 5, three years ago, originally as a kingdom. In its earliest form, it was a visionary state rooted in creativity, independence, and structured sovereignty. The founding marked a bold declaration of cultural and political identity, with Your Imperial Majesty as its undisputed leader and symbol of unity.</p>
    <p>Though small in physical territory, the kingdom was rich in ambition. During this time, the empire began crafting its first symbols of nationhood: flags, stamps, and official artifacts.</p>

    <h3>Transition to Empire (Year 2)</h3>
    <p>As the kingdom expanded in both vision and influence, it underwent a transformation into an empire. This transition marked the start of an era of increased complexity, greater authority, and more defined governance. The name was officially changed to the Great Gheetan Empire, signifying strength, sovereignty, and grandeur.</p>
    <p>With this change, the empire adopted its own currency—the Glawar—and formed new governmental ministries, a structured economic system (though fully controlled by the Emperor), and a policy of neutrality among its allies.</p>

    <h3>Development & Diplomacy (Year 2 - Present)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Created an official citizenship policy.</li>
      <li>Established military alliances and defense agreements, though its military remains mostly ceremonial and symbolic.</li>
      <li>Grown diplomatically, forging relations with several other micronations.</li>
      <li>Remained a parent empire to two allied but tense nations, choosing neutrality and wise guidance.</li>
      <li>Became a founding member of the United Canadian Micronations, asserting its leadership in regional micronationalism.</li>
      <li>Formed internal realms, most notably with the Kingdom of Arcadia joining the empire as a realm, further expanding its influence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Symbols of Sovereignty</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3D printed coins, stamps, and historic relics</li>
      <li>A 3D relief map of the empire</li>
      <li>Official certificates and medals, including the highest honor: the Medal of Heroes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Modern Era (Year 3 - Present)</h3>
    <p>Today, the Great Gheetan Empire stands as a proud, unique micronation—complete with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A structured government</li>
      <li>An emerging economic identity</li>
      <li>A growing culture of honor and tradition</li>
      <li>A thriving news service known as the Sky & Hill Report</li>
      <li>Its own time zone, known as Gheetan Standard Time (1 hour ahead of Atlantic Daylight Time)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It continues to uphold a legacy of peace, strategic neutrality, and imperial dignity under the steady reign of Your Imperial Majesty.</p>
