    <h2>About the Great Gheetan Empire</h2>
    <p>The Great Gheetan Empire is a proud and sovereign micronation founded on July 5, three years ago. Originally established as a kingdom, it quickly rose in stature and vision, becoming an empire guided by unity, honor, and imperial leadership.</p>

    <p>Led by His Imperial Majesty, the Empire champions creativity, independence, and diplomatic neutrality. Its government is structured, yet wholly directed by the Emperor, ensuring stability and continuity.</p>

    <p>The Empire boasts its own currency (the Glawar), a rich collection of custom symbols and regalia, and a distinct national identity grounded in tradition and innovation. It maintains peaceful relations with allies, serves as the parent nation to two allied realms, and continues to expand its influence through diplomacy, culture, and shared purpose.</p>

    <p>As a founding member of the United Canadian Micronations, the Great Gheetan Empire stands as a beacon of strength, sovereignty, and wisdom among modern micronations. Whether in times of ceremony or challenge, it remains loyal to its core values: Honor, Unity, and Imperial Purpose.</p>
